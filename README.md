> **Note**: The placeholder image above will be replaced with a custom visualization. This repository bridges **symbolic perspectives from historical and archivistic reasoning** (such as the differentiation of observation and context layers) with **computer vision** for **context-aware image retrieval**.

## 🎯 Overview

**i2t_graph_reasoner** is a research framework that combines symbolic reasoning principles from archival science with modern computer vision techniques to enable context-aware image-to-text retrieval. The project draws inspiration from archival methodologies that distinguish between:

- **Observation layers**: Direct visual content and features extracted from images
- **Context layers**: Historical, provenance, and relational metadata that provide meaning to observations

By representing these layers as graph structures, the framework enables sophisticated reasoning about images that goes beyond traditional content-based retrieval, incorporating the rich contextual relationships that archivists use to understand and organize visual materials.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Neuro-Symbolic Architecture**: Combines neural network-based feature extraction with symbolic graph-based reasoning
- **Dual-Layer Representation**: Separates observation (visual features) from context (metadata, provenance, relationships)
- **Context-Aware Retrieval**: Retrieves images based on both visual similarity and contextual relevance
- **Archival Reasoning Integration**: Implements principles from archival science including provenance and original order
- **Hierarchical Knowledge Graphs**: Supports multi-level representation of image collections

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system architecture consists of three main components:

### 0. **Content Layer**
- Image feature extraction using pre-trained vision models
- Text Feature Extraction

### 1. **Observation Layer (Visual Processing)**

- Object detection
- Optical Character Recognition
- Named Entity Recognition
- Noun Chunks Segmentation

### 2. **Context Layer (Symbolic Reasoning)**
- Knowledge-Graph 
- Semantic Ontology

### 3. **Graph Reasoning Engine**

## 🔬 Research Background

This project is grounded in two complementary research areas:

### Archival Science Principles
- **Context-of vs Context-for**: Distinguishing environmental context from relational context
- **Provenance**: Tracking the origin and custody history of images
- **Original Order**: Maintaining the organizational structure of collections
- **Respect des Fonds**: Keeping materials from the same source together

### Computer Vision & Graph Neural Networks
- Scene graph generation for structured image understanding
- Graph neural networks for relational reasoning
- Neuro-symbolic AI for combining learned representations with logical inference
- Content-based image retrieval enhanced with semantic graphs
